# LOCM-Project

This is the repository for Project 4 for Reinforcement Learning with Yanhua Li


seting up gym_locm:

Run the following:

pip install gym

git clone https://github.com/ronaldosvieira/gym-locm.git

cd gym-locm

pip install -e .

then import the libraries: 

import gym

import gym_locm

Then you should be able to run runner.py to simulate games of LOCM (that didn't work for me, I think because I'm on Windows, so I use runner_edit.py)
